excerpt: An experiment to see how much it would cost me to be a nicer person.

I like to think of myself as a pretty generous person, but when it comes to beggars I&#8217;m ashamed to say I&#8217;m not. If someone asks me for money on the street I&#8217;ll probably simply ignore them or mumble something about not having any change, walking past, eyes down, not acknowledging. And looking around, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the only one.

It&#8217;s hard to express my exact reasons for doing so. I think it&#8217;s a general mish-mash ranging from *&#8216;It&#8217;s my money&#8217;*, through *&#8216;It&#8217;s a scam, they actually have loads of money&#8217;* to *&#8216;They&#8217;ll probably just spend it on drugs&#8217;* and *&#8216;You look scary, I don&#8217;t want to interact with you&#8217;*. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m proud of and it&#8217;s not something I like, but it is my natural response. Or at least it used to be.

It actually all started about a year ago, when I saw a TV interview with someone begging on the street and I remember them saying that they&#8217;d rather be acknowledged, than simply ignored; even if the person didn&#8217;t give any money. And so that&#8217;s what I started to do. Whenever someone asked me for money, I&#8217;d respond simply saying *&#8216;No, sorry&#8217;*. Nothing about not having any change or any other kind of half-hearted excuse / bold-faced lie.

I decided that this approach was better (at least I was being forthright about my cheapness), but I got to thinking the other day: What would it actually cost me to say yes? To actually give some money every time someone asked me. And so that&#8217;s what I decided to do.

The basic plan was that for one month, every time someone asked me for some money I&#8217;d give them £1 and keep a tally of how much it actually cost me. However, to make sure I did things right and didn&#8217;t try to weasel out, I decided to come up with a list of rules:

  * Every time I walked by someone and they asked me for some money, I would give them £1.
  * Regardless of when I last gave them some money.
  * I had to be just as active as usual. I couldn&#8217;t just sit at home and avoid the issue.
  * I was not going to give any money to chuggers (Charity Muggers), as I personally don&#8217;t agree with what they do. I also wasn&#8217;t going to sign up to any regular donation schemes.
  * Anyone who knew what I was doing, or appeared to have figured it out, and was trying to game the system, would get nothing.
  * My decision was final (within the spirit of the exercise).

As you can probably guess from that, I was expecting this to be a fairly arduous and expensive enterprise; but hopefully somewhat interesting and illuminating.

So on the first day of April I went to the bank, got out an initial £50 in coins and then the great experiment began&#8230;

### The Results

Well, it&#8217;s actually been 48 days (which should give you some idea of just how *terribly* costly this has been), I&#8217;ve stuck to all the rules outlined above and so far it&#8217;s cost me an enormous&#8230; £17.

Which breaks down into:
  * £3 for a big issue.
  * £2 for some local kids, raising money for their school, to wash my car.
  * £12 to people begging on the street.

Seriously, that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m honestly amazed. 

Now, I&#8217;m not going to claim this will be the case for everyone. It obviously makes a huge difference where you live, how you commute, how often you go out, etc, etc, but the purpose of this experiment was to see how much it would cost **me** and so far it&#8217;s turned out to be sweet FA.

I mean, I don&#8217;t want to harp on about this, but I really am astounded. I&#8217;ve been out & about, I&#8217;ve been in the local towns & cities during the day, at evenings & weekends, I&#8217;ve been up to London a few times and all it&#8217;s cost me is £17?! I really expected it to be a lot more.

Putting the financial part to one side, I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t be surprised to hear that I also feel I need to share how this has made me feel; to chronicle my thoughts and emotions throughout this titanic endeavour:

*Do I feel good about it?* Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of cool. I think I&#8217;m going to keep it up.
