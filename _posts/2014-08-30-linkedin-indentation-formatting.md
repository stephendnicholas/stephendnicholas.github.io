Last week I decided to update my <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/stephendnicholas/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a> and I was surprised by the lack of <a href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1237/~/formatting-text-or-adding-links" target="_blank">formatting options</a>. In fact &#8216;surprised&#8217; is a severe understatement. It seems crazy to me that on the world&#8217;s foremost business social networking site, I get no more formatting options than I do in notepad! Less in fact, as you can&#8217;t even use white space or indentation to lay things out nicely (You can type it in, but LinkedIn actively removes it). God knows why. Perhaps it&#8217;s a case of school uniform thinking, to try and maintain a single &#8216;professional&#8217; look. But it&#8217;s not good enough for me.

A quick search didn&#8217;t turn up much, except for a lot of people complaining about the same problem, but I did find out you can include certain characters in your profile text. Including:

★ ♦ ✔ ■ ● ✉ ✆ •

This jazzes things up a bit, but what I really wanted was controllable whitespace. In my opinion there&#8217;s nothing better to make a document more readable and consumable. Buoyed on by being able to insert some symbols, I went on journey of trial and error through the unicode character set. 

Eventually I found one that worked, the humble &#8216;<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2000/index.htm" target="_blank">en quad</a>&#8216;. Simply copy and paste (from your system Character Map) repeated instances of this into your profile and you can eventually get something a lot nicer:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/img/linkedingoodformat.png" />

Not ideal I&#8217;ll admit, but definitely better than this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/img/linkedinbadformat.png" />

And until LinkedIn eventually catch up to the needs of their users, it will have to do.
